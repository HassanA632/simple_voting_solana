# Simple Voting System In Solana (Learning)

I plan on creating an on chain voting system using Rust and utilizing the Anchor framework. The system will (hopefully) allow users to create polls, and vote securely with votes being tracked on chain.

## Features (planned)
- Create polls with custom options
- Vote on polls (one vote per wallet)
- View live results
- Close polls once finished

Once I have the core stuff down, I plan to add a nice little front-end too. :)

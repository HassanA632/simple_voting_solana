# Simple Voting System In Solana 

A cool little early project in Solana!
I have created an on chain voting system using Rust that utilizes the Anchor framework. The system allows users to create polls, and vote securely with votes being tracked on chain.

## Features 
- Create polls with custom options
- Vote on polls (one vote per wallet restriction)
- View live results
- Close polls once time limit specified has been reached
